# Production Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to deploy the dashboard fixes to production and ensure user settings work properly for all users.

## Database Migration Required

### 1. Create User Settings Table
Run the following migration in your Supabase dashboard or via CLI:

```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/create_user_settings_table.sql
-- This creates the missing user_settings table that was causing 404 errors

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.user_settings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    marketing_emails BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    profile_visibility TEXT DEFAULT 'public' CHECK (profile_visibility IN ('public', 'private')),
    theme_preference TEXT DEFAULT 'system' CHECK (theme_preference IN ('light', 'dark', 'system')),
    language TEXT DEFAULT 'en',
    timezone TEXT DEFAULT 'UTC',
    two_factor_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()) NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()) NOT NULL
);

-- Enable RLS and create policies
ALTER TABLE public.user_settings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own settings" ON public.user_settings
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own settings" ON public.user_settings
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own settings" ON public.user_settings
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own settings" ON public.user_settings
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

### 2. Run Migration Commands

**Option A: Supabase CLI**
```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
supabase db push

# Or apply specific migration
supabase db reset --db-url="your-database-url"
```

**Option B: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the migration SQL
4. Click "Run" to execute

**Option C: Direct Database Access**
```bash
# Connect to your production database
psql "postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]:[port]/postgres"

# Run the migration file
\i supabase/migrations/create_user_settings_table.sql
```

## How It Works in Production

### 1. **Database-First Approach**
```typescript
// Production flow:
1. Try to load settings from Supabase database
2. If successful, also sync to localStorage as backup
3. If database fails, fall back to localStorage
4. If neither exists, use sensible defaults
```

### 2. **Fallback Strategy**
```typescript
// The app handles these scenarios gracefully:
- ✅ Database available → Uses database + localStorage backup
- ✅ Database down → Uses localStorage fallback
- ✅ New user → Creates default settings in both places
- ✅ Corrupted data → Falls back to defaults
```

### 3. **Error Handling**
```typescript
// Specific error codes handled:
- 42P01: Table doesn't exist → localStorage fallback
- PGRST116: No record found → Create defaults
- Network errors → localStorage fallback
- Parse errors → Use defaults
```

## Production Benefits

### ✅ **Persistent Settings Across Devices**
- Settings stored in database sync across all user devices
- When user logs in on new device, settings are fetched from database

### ✅ **Offline Resilience**
- localStorage backup ensures settings work even if database is temporarily unavailable
- User experience remains consistent during outages

### ✅ **Data Migration**
- Existing localStorage data is automatically synced to database on first load
- No user data is lost during the transition

### ✅ **Performance Optimized**
- Database provides authoritative source
- localStorage provides instant loading and offline capability
- Automatic background sync keeps both in sync

## Migration Strategy for Existing Users

### Phase 1: Deploy with Fallback (Current State)
```typescript
// Current implementation works as:
- New installations: localStorage only
- Database available: Database + localStorage
- Database unavailable: localStorage fallback
```

### Phase 2: Database Migration (After SQL run)
```typescript
// After running SQL migration:
- New users: Settings created in database automatically
- Existing users: localStorage data migrated to database on next visit
- All users: Benefit from cross-device sync
```

### Phase 3: Cleanup (Optional)
```typescript
// After migration is complete, you could:
- Remove localStorage fallback (not recommended)
- Add analytics to track database vs localStorage usage
- Implement data export features
```

## Testing in Production

### 1. **Test Database Availability**
```bash
# Test the migration worked
curl -X GET "https://your-project.supabase.co/rest/v1/user_settings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -H "apikey: your-anon-key"

# Should return 200 OK (even if empty)
```

### 2. **Test User Settings Flow**
1. Log in as test user
2. Go to Settings page
3. Change some settings and save
4. Refresh browser → settings should persist
5. Log out and log back in → settings should still be there
6. Check browser localStorage → should have backup copy

### 3. **Test Fallback Behavior**
```javascript
// Temporarily break database connection in browser console
localStorage.setItem('user_settings_test', '{"theme_preference":"dark"}');
// Settings should still load from localStorage
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### 1. **Set Up Monitoring**
```javascript
// Add to your analytics/monitoring
if (settingsLoadedFrom === 'localStorage') {
  analytics.track('settings_fallback_used', { userId: user.id });
}
```

### 2. **Database Health Checks**
```sql
-- Monitor settings table health
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_users_with_settings,
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) as unique_users,
  MIN(created_at) as first_setting,
  MAX(updated_at) as last_update
FROM user_settings;
```

## Support for Different Environments

### Development
- Uses localStorage fallback when database is not set up
- No migration required for local development

### Staging
- Test the full database migration process
- Verify fallback behavior works correctly

### Production
- Run migration during maintenance window
- Monitor for any issues during rollout
- Have rollback plan ready

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Keep application running** - localStorage fallback ensures functionality
2. **Investigate database** - Check if migration completed successfully
3. **Fix database issues** - Users won't lose data due to localStorage backup
4. **Re-run migration** - Safe to run multiple times (uses IF NOT EXISTS)

The dual-storage approach ensures zero downtime and no data loss during deployment.

## Summary

This implementation provides:
- ✅ **Production-ready database storage**
- ✅ **Offline/fallback capability via localStorage**
- ✅ **Zero-data-loss migration**
- ✅ **Cross-device synchronization**
- ✅ **Resilient error handling**

The system works immediately in production and becomes even better once the database migration is complete.
