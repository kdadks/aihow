- **Solution**: Advanced filter panel with checkboxes, visual chips, and clear controls

### 2. Limited Sorting Options
- **Issue**: Only basic sort with confusing UI
- **Impact**: Users couldn't efficiently organize comparisons by their preferences
- **Solution**: Intuitive sort dropdown with direction indicators and clear labeling

### 3. Non-responsive Table
- **Issue**: Horizontal scrolling issues on mobile devices
- **Impact**: Poor mobile experience with difficult navigation
- **Solution**: Mobile-optimized card view with tool selector

### 4. Poor Visual Hierarchy
- **Issue**: Difficult to scan and compare tools effectively
- **Impact**: Users struggled to quickly identify differences
- **Solution**: Enhanced visual design with icons, colors, and structured sections

### 5. Missing Search/Quick Filter
- **Issue**: No way to quickly find specific features
- **Impact**: Users had to manually scan through all features
- **Solution**: Real-time search with instant feedback

### 6. Export UI Issues
- **Issue**: Hidden dropdown that was hard to discover
- **Impact**: Users couldn't easily export comparisons
- **Solution**: Improved export dropdown with clear icons and labels

      const aValue = a[sortField];
      const bValue = b[sortField];
      const modifier = sortDirection === 'asc' ? 1 : -1;
      
      if (typeof aValue === 'number' && typeof bValue === 'number') {
        return (aValue - bValue) * modifier;
      }
      return String(aValue).localeCompare(String(bValue)) * modifier;
    });
  }
  
  return result;
}, [tools, filters, sortField, sortDirection]);
```

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture

```
ComparisonPage.tsx (Main page component)
â”œâ”€â”€ ComparisonGrid.tsx (Enhanced comparison logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ ComparisonTable.tsx (Responsive table component)
â””â”€â”€ ErrorBoundary.tsx (Error handling)
```

### Key Features

#### State Management
```typescript
// Local state for UI interactions
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'table' | 'cards'>('table');
const [showAdvancedFilters, setShowAdvancedFilters] = useState(false);
const [hiddenFeatures, setHiddenFeatures] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
