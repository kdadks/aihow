# Database Permission Issue - MyContent Page Fix

## Problem Identified
Users are getting 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access their content on the MyContent page, with the specific error:
```
permission denied for table users
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error indicates that Row Level Security (RLS) policies on content tables (`blog_posts`, `tool_reviews`) are still referencing the old `users` table that was removed during the database cleanup migration.

### Technical Details
- **Query**: Trying to access `blog_posts` table with user's `author_id`
- **Error**: `permission denied for table users` 
- **Cause**: RLS policies using old table references instead of `auth.uid()`

## Database Issues Found

### 1. **Outdated RLS Policies**
The RLS policies were likely created with references to the old `users` table:
```sql
-- OLD (❌ References removed users table)
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON blog_posts
  FOR SELECT
  USING (user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()));
```

### 2. **Missing Modern Auth References**
Policies should use `auth.uid()` directly instead of table lookups:
```sql
-- NEW (✅ Direct auth reference)
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON blog_posts
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = author_id);
```

## Solution Applied

### **Database Permission Fix Script**
**File**: [`DATABASE_PERMISSION_FIX.sql`](DATABASE_PERMISSION_FIX.sql)

This script:
1. **Drops old RLS policies** that might reference the removed `users` table
2. **Creates new RLS policies** using `auth.uid()` for direct authentication
3. **Enables RLS** on content tables if not already enabled
4. **Grants permissions** to authenticated users
5. **Fixes both blog_posts and tool_reviews** tables

### **New RLS Policies Structure**

#### **For Blog Posts**
```sql
-- Read access - users can see their own posts
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for own posts" ON blog_posts
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = author_id);

-- Insert access - users can create posts
CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for authenticated users only" ON blog_posts
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);

-- Update access - users can edit their own posts
CREATE POLICY "Enable update for users based on author_id" ON blog_posts
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = author_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);

-- Delete access - users can delete their own posts
CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for users based on author_id" ON blog_posts
  FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = author_id);
```

#### **For Tool Reviews**
```sql
-- Similar policies for tool_reviews table using user_id field
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for own reviews" ON tool_reviews
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Additional INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies...
```

## Implementation Steps

### **Step 1: Apply Database Fix**
Run the [`DATABASE_PERMISSION_FIX.sql`](DATABASE_PERMISSION_FIX.sql) script in your Supabase SQL editor:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Paste and execute the script
4. Verify policies are created correctly

### **Step 2: Verify Permissions**
Check that the new policies are working:
```sql
-- Check blog_posts policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'blog_posts';

-- Check tool_reviews policies  
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'tool_reviews';
```

### **Step 3: Test User Access**
- Users should now be able to access their own content
- RLS will automatically filter content based on `auth.uid()`
- No more "permission denied for table users" errors

## Why This Happened

### **During Database Migration**
1. **Tables were removed** (`users` table was dropped)
2. **RLS policies remained** with old table references
3. **Policies became broken** when referenced tables no longer existed
4. **Auth queries failed** with permission denied errors

### **Common Migration Issue**
This is a typical issue when:
- Database schema changes
- RLS policies aren't updated to match new structure
- Old references persist in security policies

## Expected Results After Fix

### ✅ **MyContent Page Should Work**
- Users can view their blog posts
- Users can view their tool reviews
- No more 403 Forbidden errors
- Content properly filtered by user ownership

### ✅ **Security Maintained**
- Users can only see their own content
- Proper read/write permissions enforced
- No unauthorized access to other users' content

### ✅ **Performance Improved**
- Direct `auth.uid()` checks are faster
- No complex table joins in RLS policies
- Simplified permission logic

## Testing Checklist

After applying the database fix:

1. ✅ **Login to user account**
2. ✅ **Navigate to MyContent page**
3. ✅ **Verify blog posts load** without 403 errors
4. ✅ **Verify tool reviews load** without 403 errors
5. ✅ **Test creating new content**
6. ✅ **Test editing existing content**
7. ✅ **Test deleting content**

## Preventive Measures

To prevent similar issues in future migrations:
1. **Update RLS policies** when changing table structures
2. **Use `auth.uid()` directly** instead of table joins in policies
3. **Test permissions** after database schema changes
4. **Document RLS dependencies** during migration planning
