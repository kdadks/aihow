# Contact Form Email Implementation

## Overview

The contact form has been successfully configured to automatically route emails to different recipients based on the inquiry type, as requested.

## Email Routing Configuration

### Support Email (`support@how2doai.ai`)
- **General Inquiry** - General questions and information requests
- **Technical Support** - Technical issues and troubleshooting
- **Feedback** - User feedback and suggestions
- **Press/Media** - Press inquiries and media requests

### Sales Email (`sales@how2doai.ai`)
- **Bundle Implementation** - Implementation services and consultation
- **Partnership** - Partnership opportunities and business collaboration

## Implementation Details

### 1. Netlify Function (`netlify/functions/send-email.js`)
- Created serverless function to handle email sending
- Uses Nodemailer with Hostinger SMTP configuration
- Supports HTML and plain text email formats
- Sends confirmation emails to users
- Includes proper error handling and logging

### 2. Email Service (`src/services/emailService.ts`)
- Frontend service to interact with the Netlify function
- Handles API calls and error management
- Provides utility functions for email routing logic
- TypeScript support with proper interfaces

### 3. Updated Contact Page (`src/pages/ContactPage.tsx`)
- Integrated with the email service
- Added error handling and user feedback
- Maintains existing form validation
- Provides clear user experience for form submission

### 4. SMTP Configuration
- **Host**: `smtp.hostinger.com`
- **Port**: `465` (SSL/TLS)
- **Security**: SSL/TLS enabled
- **Authentication**: Username/password via environment variables

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `netlify/functions/send-email.js` - Serverless email function
- `src/services/emailService.ts` - Frontend email service
- `docs/EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Email configuration guide
- `docs/CONTACT_FORM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This implementation summary
- `scripts/test-email-config.js` - Email configuration test script
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

### Modified Files
- `src/pages/ContactPage.tsx` - Updated to use email service
- `package.json` - Added nodemailer and @types/nodemailer dependencies

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
SMTP_USER=your-email@hostinger.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

## Testing

Run the email configuration test:
```bash
npm run test-email
```

This will verify:
- Email routing logic is working correctly
- SMTP configuration is properly set up
- Environment variables are configured

## Email Features

### User Experience
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Loading states during submission
- Success confirmation with option to send another message
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

- **Reply-To**: Set to user's email for easy responses

### Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS and security headers
- Rate limiting protection (via Netlify)

## Deployment Notes

1. **Development**: 
   - Set up `.env` file with SMTP credentials
   - Use `npm run dev` to start development server

2. **Production (Netlify)**:
   - Add `SMTP_USER` and `SMTP_PASS` to Netlify environment variables
   - Deploy will automatically include the serverless function

## Monitoring

- Check Netlify function logs for email sending status
- Monitor email deliverability through SMTP provider
- User feedback through the contact form success/error states

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Email templates with better branding
- Attachment support for bundle inquiries
- Integration with CRM systems
- Email analytics and tracking
