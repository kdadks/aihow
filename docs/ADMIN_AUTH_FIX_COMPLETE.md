# Admin Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The admin user `prashant.srivastav@gmail.com` can successfully authenticate via Supabase Auth but doesn't see admin functions because the `AdminAuthContext` cannot find the proper role assignments.

## Root Cause

The `AdminAuthContext` was designed to work with a specific database schema structure:
- `user_role_assignments` table linking users to roles
- `user_roles` table containing role definitions with `name` and `permissions` columns

However, the actual database might be using a different structure, causing the role lookup to fail.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Fix

Created two SQL scripts to fix the database:

**`admin-role-diagnostic.sql`** - Comprehensive diagnostic and fix script:
- Checks if the admin user exists
- Creates profile if missing
- Detects which role structure is being used (new vs legacy)
- Sets up admin roles in the correct structure
- Provides verification queries

**`fix-admin-role-assignment.sql`** - Focused role assignment script:
- Ensures proper admin role assignment for the specific user
- Handles both new and legacy schema structures

### 2. Frontend Code Fix

Updated `AdminAuthContext.tsx` to be more robust:
- **Multi-Schema Support**: Now tries three different role lookup methods:
  1. New schema: `user_role_assignments` → `user_roles`
  2. Legacy schema: `user_roles` → `roles`
  3. Direct assignment: `user_roles` with direct role data
- **Better Error Handling**: Continues trying different methods instead of failing on the first attempt
- **Improved Logging**: More detailed console logs for debugging
- **TypeScript Fixes**: Resolved all type errors

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Script
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste the contents of: admin-role-diagnostic.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Admin Access
1. The updated `AdminAuthContext` will automatically handle different schema structures
2. Try logging in at `/admin/login` with `prashant.srivastav@gmail.com`
3. The context should now properly detect admin permissions

## What This Fixes

1. **Authentication Flow**: User can log in and get proper admin state
2. **Role Detection**: Context can find admin roles regardless of schema structure
3. **Permission Assignment**: Proper admin permissions are loaded
4. **Admin Interface**: Should now show admin-specific functions and routes

## Testing Steps

1. **Login Test**: Try logging in at `/admin/login`
2. **Console Check**: Open browser dev tools and check console logs during login
3. **Admin Functions**: Verify that admin-specific UI elements appear
4. **Role Verification**: Check that the AdminAuthContext state shows `isAuthenticated: true` and proper admin role

## Fallback Options

If the main fix doesn't work:

1. **Check Console Logs**: The updated context provides detailed logging
2. **Manual Role Assignment**: Use the verification queries in the SQL scripts
3. **Schema Inspection**: Run the diagnostic script to see which structure is actually being used

## Files Modified

1. `/scripts/admin-role-diagnostic.sql` - Created
2. `/scripts/fix-admin-role-assignment.sql` - Created  
3. `/src/admin/auth/context/AdminAuthContext.tsx` - Updated

The solution is designed to be backward-compatible and handle multiple database schema configurations automatically.
