# Authentication System Overview

## Architecture

The authentication system is built on top of Supabase Auth and provides a comprehensive solution for user authentication, authorization, and session management in our React application.

### Core Components

- `AuthProvider`: Context provider that manages auth state and methods
- `useAuth`: Custom hook for accessing auth functionality
- `ProtectedRoute`: Route wrapper for auth-required pages
- `LoginForm`/`RegisterForm`: Authentication form components

### Authentication Flow

1. User initiates auth action (login/register)
2. Form component calls appropriate auth method
3. Supabase handles authentication
4. AuthProvider updates global auth state
5. Protected routes check auth state for access

### Features

- Email/Password authentication
- Session persistence
- Role-based access control
- Protected routes
- Profile management
- Error handling
- Type-safe auth state

## State Management

The auth state is managed through React Context and includes:

```typescript
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  session: Session | null;
  loading: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
}
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:

- Unit tests for hooks and utilities
- Component tests for auth forms
- Integration tests for auth flows
- Error scenario testing

For detailed test implementations, see:
- `src/auth/tests/hooks.test.tsx`
- `src/auth/tests/components.test.tsx`
- `src/auth/tests/integration.test.tsx`

## Type Safety

The system uses TypeScript throughout with strict type checking for:

- User data
- Auth state
- API responses
- Form data
