# Security Implementation

## Overview

Our authentication system implements industry-standard security practices using Supabase Auth as the backend. This document details the security measures in place and best practices for maintaining security.

## Authentication Security

### Password Security

- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Password hashing is handled by Supabase using Bcrypt
- Minimum password requirements:
  - At least 8 characters
  - Mix of uppercase and lowercase
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

### Session Management

- JWT tokens are used for session management
- Tokens are stored securely in browser storage
- Session expiration is enforced (default 1 hour)
- Auto-refresh of tokens when approaching expiration
- Secure token rotation on re-authentication

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

```typescript
// Role checking in protected routes
<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="admin">
  <AdminPanel />
</ProtectedRoute>

// Permission-based checks
if (hasPermission('create:post')) {
  // Allow action
}
```

## Security Best Practices

### XSS Prevention

1. Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are configured
2. Data sanitization on input/output
3. React's built-in XSS protection
4. Strict type checking

### CSRF Protection

1. CSRF tokens included in requests
2. SameSite cookie policy
3. Origin verification

### API Security

1. Rate limiting on auth endpoints
2. Request validation
3. Error response sanitization
4. Secure headers configuration

## Security Headers

```typescript
// Security headers configuration
{
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'",
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block'
}
```

## Error Handling

Security-related errors are handled carefully to avoid information leakage:

```typescript
try {
  await auth.login(email, password);
} catch (error) {
  // Sanitize error message
  const safeError = formatAuthError(error);
  setError(safeError);
}
```

## Data Protection

1. User data encryption at rest
2. Secure communication over HTTPS
3. Minimal data collection
4. Regular security audits
5. Data retention policies

## Security Monitoring

- Auth attempt logging
- Failed login monitoring
- Session tracking
- Regular security audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Incident Response

1. Automated account locking after failed attempts
2. Admin notifications for suspicious activity
3. User notification for security events
4. Incident response procedures

## Security Testing

Regular security testing includes:

1. Penetration testing
2. Vulnerability scanning
3. Security header validation
4. Authentication flow testing
5. Role-based access testing

## Recommendations

1. Enable 2FA when available
2. Regular security audits
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Monitor security advisories
5. Regular penetration testing
6. Security training for developers

## Compliance

- GDPR compliant
- CCPA compliant
- SOC 2 compliance measures
- Regular compliance audits
