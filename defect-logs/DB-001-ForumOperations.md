# Defect Report: DB-001
## Title: Forum Database Operations Failing

### Priority: High
### Status: Open
### Component: Database - Forum Module
### File: src/database/forum.ts

### Description
All forum-related database operations are failing due to errors in category creation, which is a prerequisite for other operations.

### Test Failures
1. Category Operations (5 failures):
   - Create category
   - Get category by ID
   - Update category
   - Delete category
   - List categories in display order

2. Topic Operations (5 failures):
   - Create topic
   - Get topic by ID
   - Update topic
   - Delete topic
   - List topics with pinned topics first

3. Reply Operations (6 failures):
   - Create reply
   - Get reply by ID
   - Update reply
   - Delete reply
   - List replies for topic
   - Prevent replies to locked topics

### Error Message
```
DatabaseError: Failed to create forum category
at createCategory src/database/forum.ts:13:22
```

### Expected Behavior
- Forum categories should be created successfully
- All CRUD operations should work for categories, topics, and replies
- Proper error handling for edge cases

### Actual Behavior
- Category creation fails consistently
- Cascading failures in topic and reply operations
- Database error propagation without proper handling

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm test`
2. Observe forum database operation failures

### Recommended Fix
1. Debug category creation SQL
2. Verify database schema and permissions
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add database connection error logging
5. Write integration tests for database setup
