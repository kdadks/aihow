# Defect Report: DB-002
## Title: Tools Database Operations Failing

### Priority: High
### Status: Open
### Component: Database - Tools Module
### File: src/database/tools.ts

### Description
Multiple failures in tools-related database operations, primarily affecting data retrieval and performance testing scenarios.

### Test Failures
1. Category Operations:
   ```
   AssertionError: expected [] to deeply equal [ { id: 'cat-1', ...(5) }, ...(1) ]
   ```
   - Failed to fetch tool categories
   - Expected predefined categories missing from results

2. Tool Operations:
   ```
   AssertionError: expected [] to deeply equal [ { id: 'tool-1', ...(10) }, ...(1) ]
   ```
   - Search with performance metrics failing
   - Empty results returned instead of expected tool data

3. Performance Testing:
   ```
   AssertionError: expected [] to have a length of 1000 but got +0
   ```
   - Large result set handling failure
   - Performance metrics test failing
   - Expected 1000 items, received empty array

### Expected Behavior
- Tool categories should be retrievable
- Tool search should return matching results
- Performance tests should handle large datasets
- Response times should be within specified thresholds

### Actual Behavior
- Empty arrays returned for category queries
- Search operations return no results
- Performance tests failing to load data
- Database queries not executing as expected

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm test`
2. Observe tools database operation failures
3. Note empty result sets in test output

### Recommended Fix
1. Verify database seeding for test data
2. Debug category retrieval query
3. Optimize search performance
4. Implement proper error handling for empty results
5. Add logging for database operations
6. Create database connection health checks
